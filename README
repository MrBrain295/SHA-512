What?
-----

The Python script "pencrypter.py" helps you *encrypt* a password using SHA-512
in a way that is compatible with most Linux systems and the results can be put
into the "/etc/shadow" file directly.

Example
-------

Let's say we want to create a new user "sdez" on a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server, and
the password for this new user is "Steven forgets his password!".

We can use this script to *encrypt* the password the user wants to use:

    $ ./pencrypter.py
    Password: (enter the 28 characters long password here)
    $6$cF.OZfPGrTfsqa2N$lWinnKejK/qjHA1/8OLxP7u19F8hUAD/AEYFCQJt9Z6bMQUiiFjUld1aoXTyNqvZCgRCWLSBSlQWuNAn581PF/

We can use "useradd" to create a new user on the system:

    $ useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash --comment 'Steven Hernandez' sdez

And we can use "usermod" command to set a password for that user:

    $ usermod --password '$6$cF.OZfPGrTfsqa2N$lWinnKejK/qjHA1/8OLxP7u19F8hUAD/AEYFCQJt9Z6bMQUiiFjUld1aoXTyNqvZCgRCWLSBSlQWuNAn581PF/' sdez
